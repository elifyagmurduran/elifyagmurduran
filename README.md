Hello.

I am a gradute from a Bachelors Degree degree program in Computer Engineering from Yıldız Technical University, currently working with the Delivery Team at Experian. I am searching for opportunities in Europe to advance further in my career so I am currently looking for an Erasmus+ Internship. If I am considered for a position, any relocation and working visa issues would be handled via the Erasmus program.


Outside of my full time work at Experian, I busy myself with working on sharpening my developer skills, and also learning and making projects on mobile programming and artificial intelligence areas. I am passionate about learning new things, because a wide variety of knowledge helps one get many different perspectives to the world, so these learning experinces are not limited to computer science areas usually. Also I am a very active person and participate in sports frequently and other times I like to work on various art projects.
