## About Me ✨

My main focus is getting my degree at the moment,  but I am trying my best to learn more about areas such as, computer graphics, game design and development and front and development, I've always been interested in areas l,ke this where it takes more than just the software skills school gives us. This is something I've always loved about my major while studying, we have an extremely wide range of options when it comes to what we want to do, our skill is so versatile that we could work with / at any industry, we can help all kinds of people. Personally, since I've always loved art since I was a kid, I've decided to use my skill to create art with software.
I also enjoy the more technical part of our field. Data science is the skill of the future and I am trying not to fall behind on that. I also find great joy in solving algorithmic problems with code, in the most efficient and straightforward way I possibly can, which you'll see plenty of in this profile.
Thank you for visiting!
