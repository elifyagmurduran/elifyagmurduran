Hello.

I am a gradute from a Bachelors Degree degree program in Computer Engineering from Yıldız Technical University, currently working with the Delivery Team at Experian. I am searching for opportunities in Europe to advance further in my career. 

Outside of my full time work at Experian, I busy myself with working on sharpening my developer skills, and also learning and making projects on mobile programming and data analysis. I am passionate about learning new things, because a wide variety of knowledge helps one get many different perspectives to the world, so these learning experinces are not limited to computer science areas usually. Also I am a very active person and participate in sports frequently and other times I like to work on various art projects.

Some of my projects are incomplete at the moment because I had done them for school assignments and they are in need of debugs. I hope to complete soon!
